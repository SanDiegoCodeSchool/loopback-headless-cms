# HEADLESS CMS

## Project Overview
This repo is home to our loopback-based headless content management system

This project was launched in response to 2 factors:
- a certain CMS decided to start charging $2 for every person that RSVP'd to an event, regardless of whether or not they actually decided to show up.
- other node-based headless CMS's just weren't cutting it. The stable ones didn't offer all of the features that we hoped for and the feature-rich projects weren't stable.
